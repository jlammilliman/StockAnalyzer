# StockAnalyzer
This is a combination of two projects from a class. The first part created the StockAnalyzer part, and the second created the UI portion. Together, they read .csv data and present it to the user. Possible plans for the future: update it to pull from internet the stocks I want to keep up with from my own portfolio
# What I've Learned
- How to use JavaFX to create custom UI
- How to read in .csv data and do productive things with it
- HBox, Labels, CheckBoxes, TextFields, LineCharts and other useful javaFX based widgets
- Use of system time commands to read and load dates
- Update and draw graphs in a window
